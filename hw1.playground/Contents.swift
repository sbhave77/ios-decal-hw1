//: ## Q1: Optionals
class Words {
    var wordA : String!
    var wordB : String!
    
    init (wordA: String?, wordB: String?) {
        self.wordA = wordA
        self.wordB = wordB
    }



//: ### Are the values passed in to the **init** function and those set to the instance
//: ### variables the same type? If not, why?
    

//: Yes, they are the same type. The instance variables are implicitly unwrapped optionals, so they are assumed to be non nil. The String **init** function variables are just a regular optional with type Optional<wrapped>. Under the hood, both of these optionals have the same type: Optional<wrapped>. From Swift reference guide, "unwrapped optionals have the same Optional<Wrapped> type as optional values".


//: ## Q2: Variable Types and Function Types
    class func arePalindromes(_ words: [String]) -> Bool {
        let reversedWords = words.map() {String($0.characters.reversed())}
        let numElements = words.count
        
        for i in 0 ..< numElements {
            if words[i] != reversedWords[i] {
                return false
            }
        }
        return true
    }
//: ### Why does the compiler dislike the **for loop**? Fix it.
//: ### What else is wrong with this function? You may have to refer to (but **not**
//: ### change) the code at the very bottom. Debug the function.



//: Nothing is wrong with the **for loop**. The issue is that the function should be a class function, not a function for a particular instance of the class.


//: ## Q3: More Functions and Object Initialization
    func isAnagram() -> Bool {
        var countLetters : [Character : Int] =  [Character: Int]() //Line X
        let lenA = self.wordA.characters.count
        let lenB = self.wordB.characters.count
        
        if lenA != lenB {
            return false
        }
        
        var arrA = Array(self.wordA.characters)
        var arrB = Array(self.wordB.characters)
        
        for i in 0...lenA-1 {
            let letter = arrA[i]
            if let val = countLetters[letter] { //Line Y
                countLetters[letter] = val + 1
            } else {
                countLetters[letter] = 1
            }
        }
        
        for i in 0...lenB-1 {
            let letter = arrB[i]
            if let val = countLetters[letter] {
                countLetters[letter] = val - 1
            } else {
                return false
            }
        }
        
        for (_, count) in countLetters {
            if count != 0 {
                return false
            }
        }
        
        return true
    }
//: ### What is the problem with declaring **countLetters** as we do in **Line X**,
//: ### and then using it in **Line Y**? Fix it (by only changing **Line X**).
//: ### What else is wrong with this function? You may have to refer to (but **not**
//: ### change) the code at the very bottom. Debug the function.


//: **countLetters** was never initialized. It must be initialized as an empty dictionary. There are a number of things that are wrong. One is that the function should not be a class function. It should be a function on the level of an instance of the class Word. Other minor errors are that the vars lenA and lenB should be constants as they are never modified. Therefore, I changed them with "let" statments instead of "var". In the countLetters loop, letter was replaced with "_" because it is never used within the loop.
